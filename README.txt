Synth Goblins
-------------

Version 2020-06-12

General MIDI instrument #102: Synth FX 6 (goblins).

Samples by 快乐爱的小精灵 (Elf of Happy and Love) <lovebodhi@yandex.com>, sent to the FreePats project on April 2020. Made with ZynAddSubFX software synthesizer. This version is edited by roberto@zenvoid.org. Originally it was Echoes FX, but it turned into the instrument #102 (goblins), which fits very well.
